  <h1>Obesity & BMI Analysis: Visualizations</h1>


  <h2>Visualization 1: Physical Activity vs. Obesity Level</h2>
  <iframe src="phys_act.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>
  <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> As obesity levels increase, the frequency of physical activity decreases significantly. Individuals classified under the "Obesity" category exhibit very low levels of weekly physical activity, with many reporting a frequency close to zero. On the other hand, those with normal or insufficient weight show more variation and higher levels of activity.
</p>
  <p><strong>Interactive Features</strong> Hover over each section of the violin plots to view detailed statistics like the median, quartiles, minimum/maximum values, and distribution density. This interactive feature makes it easy to explore and compare physical activity trends across different weight categories without needing a legend.
</p>

  <h2>Visualization 2: Family History Influence</h2>
  <iframe src="fam_his.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>
  <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Individuals with a family history of overweight are far more likely to fall into the Obesity category. In fact, over 99% of the individuals categorized as Obese reported a family history of being overweight. This pattern is also noticeable in the Overweight group, whereas the Normal and Insufficient Weight groups have a more even distribution between those with and without family history. This suggests a strong hereditary or environmental influence within families contributing to weight outcomes.
</p>
  <p><strong>Interactive Features</strong> Hover over each bar to see the exact percentage of individuals within that weight category who reported a family history of being overweight. You can also filter the chart using the radio buttons below it to view data for all individuals, or only those who answered "Yes" or "No" to the family history question. This makes it easy to compare trends across different groups.</p>

  <h2>Visualization 3: Age Influence</h2>
  <iframe src="age.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>
  <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The scatter plot shows that the overweight and obese participants have a wider age range and have more concentrations in the middle age to old age - which could suggest that obese rate increases as age increases. However, there are a lot more overweight and obese participants in the studies which might introduce bias and needs to be considered.
</p>
  <p><strong>Interactive Features</strong> Use the dropdown menu in the bottom-left corner to filter the scatter plot by weight category (e.g., Normal, Overweight, Obese). This allows you to compare how age and BMI vary across different groups.
Hovering over each dot reveals individual data values for BMI and Age, helping identify patterns, clusters, and outliers across the population.
</p>

  <h2>Visualization 4: BMI by Transportation (D3 Boxplot)</h2>
  <iframe src="d3_image.html" width="100%" height="600"></iframe>
  <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Individuals who primarily use cars or motorcycles exhibit noticeably higher BMI values compared to those who walk or bike. The median BMI for automobile users is well above the overweight threshold. In contrast, people using public transportation or walking tend to fall closer to the normal BMI range. This supports the idea that passive transportation methods may correlate with lower physical activity and, in turn, increased obesity risk.
</p>
<h2>Visualization 5: BMI vs. Snacking Frequency</h2>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Although not fully implemented, this visualization was designed to explore the relationship between individuals’ snacking frequency and their BMI. The hypothesis is that increased snacking between meals may correlate with higher BMI levels, especially in individuals already classified as overweight or obese. Early exploration of the data suggested that people who reported "Frequently" or "Always" snacking between meals had noticeably higher weight distributions.</p>

<p><strong>Interactive Features</strong> In the intended design, users would be able to hover over each box plot to reveal detailed statistics such as the median, quartiles, and outliers for each snacking frequency group. Color would be used to distinguish weight categories, making it easier to explore and compare trends across different groups. The interactive format would allow for intuitive, on-demand exploration of BMI variation without relying on static labels or legends.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Our analysis shows that obesity is influenced by a combination of physical activity, age, family history, and daily lifestyle choices such as transportation methods. We found that individuals with a family history of being overweight are significantly more likely to be obese, that physical inactivity correlates with higher obesity levels, and that passive transportation habits (like using cars or motorcycles) are linked to higher BMI. Middle-aged individuals, especially between 20–40 years old, showed a greater tendency toward obesity, emphasizing the importance of early intervention. One limitation we encountered was the imbalance in binary variables — for example, there were far more non-smokers than smokers in the dataset, making it difficult to draw meaningful comparisons across some categories. Recognizing this helped us focus on more balanced and interpretable variables. Through interactive visualizations, we were able to not only highlight these relationships but also allow viewers to explore patterns in a more personalized and meaningful way. In future work, we hope to explore more nuanced dietary behaviors, track long-term BMI trends, or even build predictive models to identify high-risk individuals. Overall, this project reinforces the importance of everyday lifestyle choices and their measurable impact on health.
