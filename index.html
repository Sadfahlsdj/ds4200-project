  <h1>Analyzing Obesity: Lifestyle Factors and BMI</h1>


  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Obesity is a pressing public health issue worldwide, linked to chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Understanding the factors that contribute to obesity is crucial for developing targeted prevention strategies. Our project explores the relationship between various personal characteristics and obesity levels, using a dataset that captures both physiological and behavioral health indicators. Through interactive visualizations, we aim to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations that can inform public health messaging, medical screening practices, and individual decision-making.</p>

  <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 2,111 observations and 17 features collected from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, along with a target variable, NObeyesdad, which classifies individuals into different obesity categories. We also computed BMI using height and weight to support our analysis.

To better understand the health profiles in this dataset, we categorized the features into two main types:

Physiological features:

Age

Gender

Height

Weight

Family history of overweight (family_history_with_overweight)

Behavioral features:

Fast food consumption (FAVC)

Frequency of vegetable consumption (FCVC)

Number of main meals (NCP)

Between-meal snacks (CAEC)

Water consumption (CH2O)

Physical activity (FAF)

Time using technology (TUE)

Transportation method (MTRANS)

Alcohol consumption (CALC)

Smoking habits (SMOKE)

These categories help us differentiate between inherited or biological predispositions and lifestyle choices when analyzing their impact on obesity outcomes.
