    <h1>Analyzing Obesity: Lifestyle Factors and BMI</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>Obesity is a pressing public health issue worldwide, and understanding the factors that contribute to obesity can help to devise more diverse health strategies. 
Our project is aimed towards finding the correlation between eating habits, physical conditions, and obesity levels using a dataset that contains a variety of features related to these aspects. 
By analyzing the data and creating visualizations, our project aims to gain insight on how different factors impact obesity levels. The findings could be used to inform public health initiatives and individual health practices.
Identifying the trends and relationships between eating habits, physical condition, and obesity is vital for addressing health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension, which are often correlated to obesity. 
Knowing which factors impact obesity the most could inform people who are at risk about how to minimize said risk. 

    <p>The dataset includes 2,111 observations and 17 attributes collected from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. It includes both numerical attributes (like weight, 
height, age, water consumption) and categorical attributes (such as smoking habits, transportation method, family history of obesity). The target variable, <code>NObeyesdad</code>, 
classifies individuals into different obesity categories. 
We also derived a BMI variable from height and weight to enhance analysis.</p>

    <h2>Visualization 1: Physical Activity vs. Obesity Level</h2>

   <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> As obesity levels increase, the frequency of physical activity decreases significantly. Individuals classified under the "Obesity" category exhibit very low levels of weekly physical activity, with many reporting a frequency close to zero. On the other hand, those with normal or insufficient weight show more variation and higher levels of activity.</p>

<p><strong>Design:</strong> A violin plot was selected to capture the full distribution of physical activity frequency across weight categories. The plot includes an inner box to highlight medians and quartiles, layered within a KDE (kernel density estimate) shape that reveals how responses are concentrated. The color coding reinforces categorical distinctions.

This plot is made interactive using Plotly — users can hover over each section of the violins to reveal tooltips showing statistical markers such as the median, quartiles, min/max, and density values. The interactivity makes it easy to explore and compare activity trends within and between different weight classes without needing to refer to a static legend or external documentation.

    <h2>Visualization 2: Family History Influence</h2>
    <iframe src="fam_his.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
   <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Individuals with a family history of overweight are far more likely to fall into the obesity category. This trend is especially dominant in the 'Obesity' and 'Overweight' groups.</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> A grouped bar chart with color-coded bars (yes/no) was used to show the distribution within each weight group. This makes the contrast between family history and obesity levels immediately apparent.</p>


    <h2>Visualization 3: Age Influence</h2>
    <iframe src="age.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Most individuals with higher BMI values fall in the middle-age range (20–40 years old), with obesity more concentrated in that cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> A scatter plot with color-coded points and a dropdown filter helps isolate trends by weight type. Interactivity helps highlight individual groups or compare them together.</p>

    <h2>Visualization 4: BMI by Transportation (D3 Boxplot)</h2>
    <iframe src="d3_image.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Individuals using cars or motorcycles tend to have higher BMI values than those walking or using public transportation, suggesting a link between daily activity and weight.</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> We implemented a D3.js boxplot to show BMI distribution for each transportation method. Reference lines for BMI categories were added to help interpret health ranges.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
Our analysis confirms several correlations between lifestyle factors and obesity. Physical inactivity, poor eating habits, and family history are strongly linked to higher obesity levels. We also observed that active transport users (like walkers or public transit riders) generally have lower BMI values. In the future, we hope to explore temporal changes or test predictive models to further validate our insights.
