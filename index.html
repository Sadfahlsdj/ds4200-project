  <h1>Analyzing Obesity: Lifestyle Factors and BMI</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Obesity is a pressing public health issue worldwide, and understanding the factors that contribute to obesity can help to devise more diverse health strategies. 
    Our project is aimed towards finding the correlation between eating habits, physical conditions, and obesity levels using a dataset that contains a variety of features related to these aspects. 
    By analyzing the data and creating visualizations, our project aims to gain insight on how different factors impact obesity levels. The findings could be used to inform public health initiatives and individual health practices.
    Identifying the trends and relationships between eating habits, physical condition, and obesity is vital for addressing health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension, which are often correlated to obesity. 
    Knowing which factors impact obesity the most could inform people who are at risk about how to minimize said risk.</p>

  <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
  <p>The dataset includes 2,111 observations and 17 attributes collected from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. It includes both numerical attributes (like weight, 
  height, age, water consumption) and categorical attributes (such as smoking habits, transportation method, family history of obesity). The target variable, <code>NObeyesdad</code>, 
  classifies individuals into different obesity categories. 
  We also derived a BMI variable from height and weight to enhance analysis.</p>
